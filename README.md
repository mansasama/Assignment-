Due to the way many municipal recycling contracts have traditionally been structured, the recycling industry has not developed over time and this has led, with our 1.3 billion population, to a society where we do not worry about living our entire life surrounded by dump. Under these conditions recycling is very necessary and to make this possible we require something that is both easy to understand, use and can make a breakthrough, ripple like effect throughout.
Software applications can allow the users to manage their waste and recycling, find nearby locations for pick-up, discover industry news and insights and increase their knowledge about where items should go to avoid landfill buildup. Every product’s life-cycle extends beyond what it is advertised for. Once the primary user has extracted its basic utility, it is sorted and processed in a decentralized, eco-friendly manner. There is little to nothing to be spared for the incinerator or landfills.

The idea to provide this with a solution is not entirely easy, but trying to provide answers to the few major issues is more important. A few things must be taken into consideration, such as:

1. To improve the ideology with a little math, the coupon counting based on brand might be the better idea but to make this happen the user interface must be great and easily usable by everyone so I would say using picture/graphics based selection system is the better choice. 

2. This also needs to grab the attention of the busy workers, since a lot of the population would want to work for their daily necessities instead of worrying about other "unnecessary" chores. To do this the application needs to provide the customers with feasible offers.

3. The math for the Waste to Money conversion is better described in the form of a Matrix, as it takes into consideration the weight, type of waste and the quality (PIC for plastic), instead of a regular mathematical expression.
*PIC –Plastic Identification Code.

4. The coupon points should be loaded onto a card which is more accessible and this way the points maybe redeemed for the metro train or for groceries and daily necessities.

Why let something go decompose for 100's of years when it can be recycled in minutes.


I personally couldn’t manage to code well enough to develop a full application and convert it into a .JAR file. Though the process is entirely understood, the writing and reading data from a “.XML” file deemed to be more time consuming and require more understanding.
