Due to the way many municipal recycling contracts have traditionally been structured, the recycling industry has not developing over time. And this has led, with our 1.3 billion population, to a society where we do not worry about living a life surrounded with dump. Under these conditions recycling is very necessary and to make this possible.
Software applications can allow the users to manage their waste and recycling, find nearby locations for pick-up, discover industry news and insights and increase their knowledge about where items should go to avoid landfill buildup. Every productâ€™s life-cycle extends beyond what it is advertised for. Once the primary user has extracted its basic utility, it is sorted and processed in a decentralized, eco-friendly manner. There is little to nothing to be spared for the incinerator or landfills.

The idea to provide this with a solution is not entirely easy, but trying to provide answers to the few major issues is more important. A few things must be taken into consideration, such as:

1. To improve the ideology with a little math, the coupon counting based on brand might be the better idea but to make this happen the user interface must be great and easily usable by everyone so I would say using picture/graphics based selection system is the better choice. 

2. This also needs to grab the attention of the busy workers, since a lot of the population would want to work for their daily necessities instead of worrying about other "unnecessary" chores. To do this the application needs to provide the customers with feasible offers.

3. The math for the Waste to Money conversion is better described in the form of a Matrix, as it takes into consideration the weight, type of waste and the quality, instead of a regular mathematical expression.

4. The coupon points should be loaded onto a card which is more accessible and this way the points maybe redeemed for the metro train or for groceries and daily necessities.
